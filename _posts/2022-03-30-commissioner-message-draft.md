Congratulations on your outstanding academic career. Your accomplishments at your university have made you one of the highest-rated players in this year's HackHPC@ADMI22 Draft. 
 
As a result, you have the opportunity to represent your university as you join us at the HackHPC@ADMI draft on Thursday, March 31 via the virtual Zoom Auditorium. Many former players – including Joselyn Hernandez, and Edgar Garza -- began their careers by being introduced live at HackHPC. 
The players who have been with us for the ADMI experience will tell you that it was truly a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity. It is an important way for fans to get to know the top new players coming into our league and we plan other activities to ensure that the trip is worthwhile and memorable. 
>The HackHPC@ADMI22 Draft will begin at 7pmET 3/31/22, with each University having a chance at being awarded the first pick after the Technical Mentor Project Pitches. This is a vital chance as the competition for projects will be fierce.
 
Je’aime Powell, our vice president of ADMI communications, will contact you to discuss the arrangements. We are committed to doing everything possible to make your HackHPC@ADMI22 hackathon a wonderful experience for you and your university family. We hope you will join us. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John Holly
Commissioner, HackHPC@ADMI22 Draft
