The first annual *HackHPC@ADMI* will kick-off Thursday, March 31st and will be held virtually. Teams will be comprised of 3-5 students and a host mentor from the same university. Subject matter experts will pitch potential projects the teams can then decide to attempt over the ~96 hour hackathon for presentation and judging Monday, April 4th @6:00pm ET. Pre-event training sessions will take place before and during the ADMI22 Symposium (a full schedule will be later released).

*Note: Registration for this hackathon does not automatically register you for the [ADMI Symposium](https://www.admiusa.org/admi2022/).*
