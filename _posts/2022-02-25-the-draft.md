The first annual *HackHPC@ADMI* will Kick-Off Thursday, March 31st and will be held virtually. Each hackathon team will be representing their home colleges and/or universities. After potential project pitches from subject matter experts the teams will "draft" the wanted project on which to work. We can not wait to see which project your team picks!
