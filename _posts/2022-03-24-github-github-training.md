HackHPC's "GitHub and Discord" pre-event training took place on March 24th, 2022. The event was hosted by Organizer [Je'aime Powell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeaimehp/). The session covered [Discord](https://discord.com/) basic usage and qwerks, basic use of the [GitHub](https://github.com/) web interface and Markdown as well as HackHPC@ADMI22 general information. The usage of both Discord and GitHub were addressed as directly related to hackathon [deliverables](2022-03-01-deliverables.md).
