We at HackHPC are celebrating our fourth year organizing and hosting hackathons as a group! We began in th ballroom of a hotel after the PEARC 2018 Conference to now running virtual hackathons starting at the PEARC 2020 Conference our team has grown to become a family. From our [past hackathons](http://hackhpc.org/pasthacks/#content2) to this we continue to put our participants, mentors, judges, and helpers first to ensure everyone benefits from these events!

As we have progressed our HackHPC community network has grown over the years. We would like to formally invite you to join that community now by joining our **[HackHPC Alumni LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8859728/)**. As sponsors, and other organizations offer both academic and professional opportunities we share them with our participants through that channel.
