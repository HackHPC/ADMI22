I"Å<p>We at HackHPC are celebrating our fourth year organizing and hosting hackathons as a group! We began in th ballroom of a hotel after the PEARC 2018 Conference to now running virtual hackathons starting at the PEARC 2020 Conference our team has grown to become a family. From our <a href="http://hackhpc.org/pasthacks/#content2">past hackathons</a> to this we continue to put our participants, mentors, judges, and helpers first to ensure everyone benefits from these events!</p>

<p>As we have progressed our HackHPC community network has grown over the years. We would like to formally invite you to join that community now by joining our <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8859728/">HackHPC Alumni LinkedIn Group</a></strong>. As sponsors, and other organizations offer both academic and professional opportunities we share them with our participants through that channel.</p>
